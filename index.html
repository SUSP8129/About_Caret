        <p>In this article, I will tell you about "Caret", one of the Chrome extensions.</p>
        <p>Mainly for Chromebook users.</p> 
        
        <h2 class="first" id="section1">1. What Is "Caret"?</h2>
            <p class="one">"Caret" is one of the Chrome extensions.</p>
            <p>It has many features and can be configured according to your 
                 (programming) language and operating environment. </p>
            <div data-image="(Caret_Webstore.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image webstore", src="Caret_Webstore.png", alt="Caret - Preview" 
                data-title="(Caret - Webstore)" data-caption="('Caret' on the Web Store)">
            </div>    
            <p class="one">Now, suppose you create a text file as Notepad.</p>
            <p class="one">Let's assume that you have taken notes about PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Action Cycle).</p>
            <p class="one">This time, save the file containing this memo as "PDCA_cycle.txt" in a folder named "Text Files".</p>
            <div data-image="(Sample_before-disappeared.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image sample_before" src="Sample_before-disappeared.png" alt="Saved location on the files app"
                data-title="(Sample_before-disappeared)" data-caption="(Saved location on the files app)">    
            </div>
            <p class="one">On the Files app, it was displayed like the image above.</p>
            <div data-image="(Sample_1_Caret.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image sample_caret", src="Sample_1_Caret.png", alt="Sample - Caret" 
                data-title="(image-title)" data-caption="(description)">
            </div>
            <p>Next, open this file in your default text editor, "Text".</p>
            <div data-image="(Chrome_Text-Extension.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image text_extension", src="Chrome_Text-Extension.png", alt="Chrome-Text('Text') in Extensions"
                data-title="(image-title)" data-caption="(description)">
            </div>
            <p>
                *Please note: Depending on your device, "Text" may not be the default text editor [for Chromebook(s)].
            </p>
            <div data-image="(Sample_1_Chrome-text.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image sample_text", src="Sample_1_Chrome-text.png", alt="Sample - Text"
                data-title="(image-title)" data-caption="(description)">
            </div>
            <p class="one">What is the difference between these two text editors?</p>
            <p class="answer">- The answer is that "Caret" has more features than "Text".</p>

        <h2 class="second" id="section2">2. What Is the Good Point?</h2>
            <p class="two">First, please watch the following video.</p>
    
            <video controls width="250">
            <source src="Caret-features.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      
            Download the
            <a href="Caret-features.mp4">MP4</a>
            video.
            </video>
            <p class="two">Did you understand the benefits of using "Caret"?</p>
            <p class="two">It can be autofilled to some degree depending on the (programming) language used.</p>
            <p class="two">It is certain that this function is at least more complete than "Text".</p>

        <h2 class="third" id="section3">3. But, "Caret" is not Perfect</h2>
            <p class="three">
                As mentioned earlier, "Caret" is multifunctional, but, it does not have 100% of the functionality you need.
            </p>
            <p class="three">
                For example, compared to Visual Studio Code for Windows and its Web version, 
                Visual Studio Code for the Web, it clearly lacks functionality. 
            </p>
            <p class="three">
                I believe this is unavoidable, as Caret is only one of the Chrome extensions.
            </p>
            <p class="three">However, Caret has one more serious problem.</p>
            <p class="three">
                The problem is that in some models, some or all of the files 
                stored in the PC's internal storage disappear when the PC is rebooted. 
            </p>
            <p class="three">    
                In fact, the problem occurred frequently on the Chromebook 
                used by the author of this article.
            </p>
            <p class="three">
                Also, as of October 23, 2024, this extension has never been updated since 2020, 
                so there is no prospect of this problem being fundamentally resolved.
            </p>
            <div data-image="(Sample_before-disappeared.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image sample_before" src="Sample_before-disappeared.png" alt="Saved location on the files app"
                data-title="(Sample_before-disappeared - Re-posted)" data-caption="(Saved location on the files app)">    
            </div>
            <p class="three">This is an image representing the storage location mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p class="three">
                However, after rebooting the PC and looking at its storage location, 
                it sometimes looked like the following image: 
            </p>
            <div data-image="(Sample_disappeared.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image sample_after" src="Sample_disappeared.png" alt="Saved location on the files app - after rebooted" 
                data-title="(Disappeared!?)" data-caption="(There is a missing file.)">
            </div>
            <p class="three">
                The image above shows that the file "PDCA_Cycle.txt" 
                that was just saved has disappeared.
            </p>

        <h2 class="fourth" id="section4">4. So, Have the Saved Files Really Disappeared?</h2>
            <p class="four">
                Let's look deeper into the internal storage to see 
                if the files have really disappeared.
            </p>
            <div data-image="(Show-hidden-files_Activated.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image show-hidden-files" src="Show-hidden-files_Activated.png" alt="Activate 'Show hidden files'" 
                data-title="(Activate 'Show hidden files')" data-caption="(Show hidden files)">
            </div>
            <p class="four">
                First, enable "Show hidden files" in the File app, 
                as shown in the image above.
            </p>
            <p class="four">
                Next, open the hidden files folder ".Trash".
            </p>
            <div data-image="(Hidden_folder-.Trash.png)">
                <img class="fullscreen-image trash" src="Hidden_folder-.Trash.png" alt=".Trash"
                data-title="(.Trash)" data-caption="(Open '.Trash')">
            </div>
            <p class="four">
                In this case, two folders "files" and "info" appeared.
            </p>
            <p class="four"></p>
            <ul class="files_info">
                <img class="fullscreen-image files" src="Hidden_folder-.Trash_files.png" alt=".Trash-files">
                <img class="fullscreen-image info" src="Hidden_folder-.Trash_info.png" alt=".Trash-info">
            </ul>
            <p class="four">
                These images show that "PDCA_cycle.txt" has been completely deleted from the device.
            </p>
            <p class="four">
                As with the previous steps, I checked to see if this file had been moved to another folder, 
                but could not find it.
            </p>
            <p class="four">
                Also, no hits were found using the search function of the file app. 
            </p>
            <p class="four">
                Therefore, it was proven that files created using "Caret" could be lost 
                when the device is rebooted if they are saved to the device's internal storage.
            </p>    
         
        <h2 class="fifth" id="section5">5. Should We Use "Caret"?</h2>
            <p class="five">
                There are three ways to avoid having files created with "Caret" disappear when the device is rebooted.
            </p>
            <p class="five"><b>
                (1) Save files to Google Drive or other cloud storage
            </b></p>
            <p class="five"><b>
                (2) Before rebooting the device, open the file created in "Caret" with "Text" and save it again
            </b></p>
            <p class="five"><b>
                (3) Edit using other text editors (including "Text") instead of "Caret" 
            </b></p>
            <p class="five">
                (1) and (2) are ways to use "Caret" functionality, while (3) is a way to circumvent "Caret"
                vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p class="five">
                Which option would you choose?
            </p>
            <p class="five">
                In the next section, I will present individual approaches to those who chose each option.
            </p>    

        <h2 class="sixth" id="section6">6. Let's Try "Caret"!</h2>
            <p class="six">
                If you chose (1) or (2) in the previous question, click the green button below to install the "Caret" extension.
            </p>
            
            <button class="button01" type="button" 
                onclick="move('https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en')">

            </button>
            <script src="script1.js"></script>

            <p class="six">
                Next, if you chose (2) and you are using a device that does not have "Text" installed as the default text editor, 
                please click the blue button below to install the "Text" extension.
            </p>
        
            <button class="button02" id="my-button" onclick="move('https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/text/mmfbcljfglbokpmkimbfghdkjmjhdgbg')">
                Jump to Chrome Web Store - Text
            </button>
            <script src="script2.js"></script>

            <p class="six">
                Finally, if you chose (3), please click the orange button below to find and install your favorite text editor.
            </p>

            <button class="button03"
                onclick="move('https://chromewebstore.google.com/')">

            <script src="script3.js"></script>  
            
            <p class="six">
                Similarly to those who chose (2), if you are using a device that does not have "Text" installed as the default text editor 
                and would like to use it, click the blue button above to install it.
            </p>
    
            <div class="pleasenote1"><b>
                *Please note: Depending on the operating environment,

        <h2 class="seventh" id="section7">7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="seven">
                I have introduced "Caret" so far, how would you feel about using it?
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                The answer is different for everyone, but if you are interested in developing with Chrome extensions, 
                please refer to this article and try "Caret" once.
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                It is especially recommended for Chromebook users.
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                As mentioned earlier, when using this extension, it is important not to save directly from "Caret" to internal storage.
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                As long as this is taken care of, you can use this extension as a somewhat full-featured text editor.
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                I hope that the contents of this article will be of some help to you in your future development and other activities.
            </p>
            <p class="seven">
                Thank you for reading to the end.
